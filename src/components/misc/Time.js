                <h2>Terminology</h2>
                    <p>The terms Pre-Banishment (PB) and Anno Lucis (AL) are used to designate years in the Vrioskan calendar. The term Anno Lucis is High Draconic and means "in the year of light".
                        These calendar eras are based on the traditionally reckoned year of the vanishing of the Three Kings (TODO: Link to the Three Kings) with AL counting years from the start of
                        that epoch and PB counting years before that epoch; Thus there is no year zero and AL 1 immediately follows 1 PB.
                    </p>
                <h2>Vrioskan Calendar</h2>
                <p>The Vrioskan Calendar was originally designed and put in place by the Great Dragons, and its thirteen months are named for the greatest among them. Each month is composed of exactly
                    28 days, further composed of 4 weeks of 7 days. The months are as follows:
                </p>
                <p>Each month ends in the High Draconic suffix '-run' which translates to 'reign of'. The months are named as such to acknowledge that these thirteen were the predominant forces in the `One True War`(TODO: Link to OTW). </p>
